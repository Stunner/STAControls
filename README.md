# STAControls #

STAControls is a collection of classes that aim to make dealing with Cocoa's UIControl subclasses more convenient, and to reduce the complexity of the code you write when getting these controls to do seemingly no-brainer things such as:

* dismissing the keyboard when the *return* key is pressed
* switching to another text field when the *return* key is pressed
* having placeholder text reappear when the keyboard is no longer selected (and text field is still blank)

As well as more advanced things such as:

* display an accessory view that allows for fast switching between adjacent UIControls
* provide a date text field (STADateField)
* provide an ATM text field (STAATMTextField) which takes in currency input like an ATM machine
